This week I began researching how to automate the process of dashboards with grafana. Our senior project requires a lot more automation principles and I figured that it is important to not have to set up our monitoring systems configuration multiple times if we need to reset an instance or migrate it to a new server. One of the ways I have found to automate this is grafana provisioning. I began by testing this as localhost. 

First, I created a few directories. Provisioning, datasources, and the datasource file as well.

grafana/provisioning/datasources/datasource.yml

My datasource file consists of

apiVersion: 1
 
datasources:
  - name: Prometheus
    type: prometheus
    access: proxy
    url: http://localhost:9090

I then downloaded a pre-made dashboard in .json format and placed it within the dashboards directory. 

I then created a provider config file as follows,

apiVersion: 1
 
providers:
  - name: 'Default'
    folder: 'Services'
    options:
      path: /etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards

After I was able to start my EC2 i did not find either the datasource or that dashboard on grafana. I am still researching as to why these do not automatically get passed.
