I decided to implement alerts into our grafana application so that we can receive notifications that our infrastructure may be down or experience issues. I wanted to implement this because in the real world it is incredibly costly to a business if an organization has long downtime due to a server. 

The first step I took was verifying that my grafana_use_provisioning is set to true within my defaults/main.yml file. If it was not set to true, grafana will not send alerts. 

After that I had to modify the custom.ini file to configure the alerts. 

Within the SMTP/ Emailing section, this is my configuration

#################################### SMTP / Emailing ##########################
[smtp]
enabled = true
host = smtp.my.csun.edu:587
user =karo.torosyan.863@my.csun.edu
# If the password contains # or ; you have to wrap it with triple quotes. Ex """#password;"""
password = PW
;cert_file =
;key_file =
skip_verify = true
from_address = karo.torosyan.863@my.csun.edu
from_name = Grafana
# EHLO identity in SMTP dialog (defaults to instance_name)
;ehlo_identity = dashboard.example.com
# SMTP startTLS policy (defaults to 'OpportunisticStartTLS')
;startTLS_policy = NoStartTLS

Currently I am still undergoing testing as I am not sure how to configure grafana to send me an email when there is an issue within the monitoring.
