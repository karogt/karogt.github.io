Blog 4

I wanted to learn more about webpages in HTML in order to make a more pleasant web page to look at. One thing I discovered was HTML classes and how they can be used to have better organization and symmetry within a webpage. This works by writing how you want a certain heading, paragraph, or other elements within the HTML code to look like repeatedly. 

We can do this by defining the style at the top of the webpage and then the class for the element. It would work as such.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.Blog {
  background-color: green;
  color: white;
  border: 3px solid black;
  margin: 30px;
  padding: 30px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="Blog">
<h2>Karo's Blog</h2>
<p>This is where something important goes.</p>
</div>


Under <style> , I listed how I want my blog style to look like, and when I reference the .Blog style and add it to the second heading under the <div class="Blog"> line, the style is added automatically. 
```
