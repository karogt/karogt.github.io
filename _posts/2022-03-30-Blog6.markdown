I have been working on getting alerts integrated into slack so that my team can see if there is something wrong with the instance. One of the main ways I was able to do this was with the alert manager. Alertmanager is an add-on with Prometheus kind of like node exporter. With some configuration, we can use the alert manager to send specified alerts to a bunch of different addresses so that we can see what we want to. I started off by installing an alert manager and creating its own directory. After I had to create multiple files for the configs to work with ansible to get this all automated and I had to modify my previous files to get things working properly. I think the most important configuration files were the alert.rules.yml  file and the alertmanager.yml file. My alertmanager.yml file holds all the configurations of where I want my alerts to go and how I want them templated. 
The main configuration is as follows,
```
global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m

route:
  group_by: ['alertname']
  group_wait: 10s
  group_interval: 10s
  repeat_interval: 1m
  receiver: 'slack-notifications'
receivers:
- name: 'slack-notifications'
  slack_configs:
  - api_url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T037EGP6V7/B039N4G8P2/tBpGJKbHg6CUf56KIUlh7O"
    channel: '#tests'
    send_resolved: true
```
By specifying the slack configs and the webhook URL, I was able to get the alerts sent over there by testing the alert rules themselves.
```
groups:
- name: alert.rules
  rules:
  - alert: InstanceDown
   # Condition for alerting
    expr: up == 0
    for: 5s
      annotations:
      title: "Instance {{ $labels.instance }} down"
      description: "{{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }} has been down for more than 1 minute."
       labels:
        severity: 'critical'
```
I tested it by stopping node_exporter on my instance and then waiting for alert manager to send over the notification.
